                    So far, we have been writing code that generally runs in a sequential manner. However, there are times where we want to only run code if some conditions are met. Other times, we would want to run a block of code multiple times. This is where conditional statements and loops come in!
                <div class="highlight font-semibold mt-2">
                    Conditional Statements (If/Elif/Else)
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        If we want to run a block of code only if a condition is satisfied, we use the "if" keyword. It has the following syntax:
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nif <condition>:\n\t# codeblock to run")}</div>
                    <p>
                        For example, if we want to print a string only if it comprised of alphabet letters (a-z) and numbers (0-9) (also called alphanumeric characters), we can use the following code:
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nusername = input()\nif username.isalnum():\n\tprint(username)")}</div>
                    <p>
                        Note that the method "isalnum" returns True if a string only consists of alphanumeric characters and returns False otherwise. So, if isalnum returns True, then we print the provided username.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we want to run another block of code in case the condition failes, then we use the "else" keyword. It has the following syntax:
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nif <condition>:\n\t# codeblock to run if true\nelse:\n\t# codeblock to run if false")}</div>
                    <p>
                        Continuing from the previous example, if the username is not alphanumeric, we may want to inform the user that the username is invalid. We can do that using the else statement.
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nusername = input()\nif username.isalnum():\n\tprint(username)\nelse:\n\tprint(\"Invalid username. Please only use alphanumeric characters.\")")}</div>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, we want to run a block of code if it fails a certain condition but also satisfies other conditions. In these scenarios, we use the "elif" keyword. It has the following syntax:
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nif <condition>:\n\t# codeblock to run if true\nelif <another condition>:\n\t# codeblock to run\nelse:\n\t# codeblock to run if false")}</div>
                    <p>
                        Continuing from the previous example, we may want to reject usernames that are reserved, such as "admin" or contains reserved words. We can do that by modifying the code to be the following:
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nusername = input()\nif username == \"admin\" or \"riot\" in username:\n\tprint(\"Invalid username. Username mustn't contain reserved words or keywords\")\nelif username.isalnum():\n\tprint(username)\nelse:\n\tprint(\"Invalid username. Please only use alphanumeric characters.\")")}</div>
                </div>
                <div class="highlight font-semibold mt-2">
                    Loops
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, we want to run a block of code multiple times. For example, printing all square of numbers from 1 to 1000, or taking the input X times. For the first scenario, we may be able to do it through brute force and enough patience such as:
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nprint(1)\nprint(4)\nprint(9)\n# ...\nprint(1000000)\n")}</div>
                    <p>
                        If we were to print square of numbers from 1 to 1000000, it would still be possible however this method is highly impractical. In fact, this cannot work for certain scenarios, such as the 2nd scenario. Think about it. How many lines of input do we make?
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nn = int(input())\ninput_1 = input()\ninput_2 = input()\ninput_3 = input()\n# how many more lines? What if n is only 1? What if n is 1000?")}</div>
                    <p>
                        There are many ways of tackling these problems, and one common way is through the use of "for loops". It has the following syntax:
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nfor <element> in <sequence>:\n\t# do something with <element>")}</div>
                    <p>
                        You'll often see it in the following way:
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nn = int(input())\nfor i in range(n):\n\tprint(n) # or something")}</div>
                    <p>
                        Try to run the code above and see what it prints! This is important since beginners tend to overlook this standard of counting in programming called 0-based indexing.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="highlight font-semibold mt-2">
                    Lists
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Often times, we not only want to run a command multiple times. We'll also want to take the input multiple times. If you recall, the template that this module provides for taking in a dynamic number of input on a single line is:
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nnumbers = list(map(int, input().split()))")}</div>
                    <p>
                        If you use it on the input "1 2 3 4 5 6 7" and print numbers, you may get an output such as "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]". Notice that the numbers are surrounded by "[]". This indicates that "numbers" is a list. Lists are variables that can contain multiple values. You can access each of its elements using the index operator "[]". For example:
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nnumbers = [100, 200, 300]\nprint(numbers[0]) # outputs 100\nprint(numbers[-1]) # outputs 300")}</div>
                    <p>
                        Index 0 refers to the 1st element, index 1 refers to the second, so on and so forth. You can also index starting from the end using -1. Lists are powerful data structures that have a lot nuances which you can get a hang of through practice. But for simplicity, you can consider list[index] to be a variable for a single value and perform operations as you normally would.
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nline = [1, 2, 3] # not the best, but it works\nslope = -line[0]/line[1]")}</div>
                    <p>
                        You can also modify the elements of a list!
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nbatches_ranked = [2023, 2022, 2021, 2020]\nbatches_ranked[0] = 2024")}</div>
                    <p>
                        And add new elements at the list!
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nreps = ['miko', 'paolo', 'krisha', 'drei']\nreps.push('kung sino iboto niyo')")}</div>
                    <p>
                        And delete elements from the list!
                    </p>
                    <div class="pl-4">{@html marked("```python\nreps = ['miko', 'paolo', 'krisha', 'drei']\ndel reps[0]")}</div>

                For this activity, you will need to create a function that generates a mandala pattern (you can search it up). Use the following template, where num_rows is an integer representing the number of rows, num_cols is an integer representing the number of columns, and pattern is a list of strings representing a num_rows by num_cols design.
                <div>{@html marked("```python\ndef gen_mandala_pattern(num_rows, num_cols, pattern):\n\t#generate pattern\n\treturn new_pattern")}</div>
